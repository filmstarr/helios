helios
======

A stylish and simple sun clock showing you the position of the sun relative to the horizon, sunrise and sunset. Whatever your location, whatever the time of year.

helios can be viewed as a stand alone webpage, or used as a LockHTML theme for jailbroken iOS devices (place theme in /var/mobile/Library/LockHTML).

helios uses paper.js, suncalc.js, jQuery and freegeoip.net. An internet connection is required to retrieve your location from freegeoip.net.

helios is inspired by Max Katzmann's preview of the tweak Solar.
